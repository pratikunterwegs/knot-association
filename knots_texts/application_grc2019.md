I study the movement of red knots (a shorebird) from two different but complementary angles - first, with high resolution tracking with the ATLAS system in the Dutch Wadden Sea to describe patterns in individual movement, and second, with individual based models to understand the rules underlying movement. I to try to link the ecology and evolution of the causes and consequences of variation in movement behaviour using information on individual differences ("personalities") in exploratory behaviour among our tracked birds and extensive, high resolution sampling of the resource landscape.
