	abstract = {Among shorebirds, many individuals make migratory and short-distance movements in large flocks, suggesting that stable social groups may persist within populations for days to months. We examined high-tide associations among individual radio-marked Dunlin wintering at Humboldt Bay, California, to determine if flocks represented stable social groups. The rate of co-occurrence of two individuals in the same flock was generally low (x̄= 15\% of surveys), and 86\% of pairs co-occurred no more than expected by chance. Associations were ephemeral, lasting 1.1 consecutive high tides on average. Variation in co-occurrence reflected individual fidelity to roosts, as well as population-wide differences in space use with precipitation and time of day. Dunlin flock composition was fluid, and individuals appeared to associate by chance according to shared attraction to common roosts. Our findings are consistent with predictions for a highly mobile, generally nonterritorial, long-distance migrant for which stable social associations have no clear benefit.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary function and maintenance of variation in animal personality is still under debate. Variation in the size of metabolic organs has recently been suggested to cause and maintain variation in personality. Here, we examine two main underlying notions: (i) that organ sizes vary consistently between individuals and cause consistent behavioural patterns, and (ii) that a more exploratory personality is associated with reduced survival. Exploratory behaviour of captive red knots (Calidris canutus, a migrant shorebird) was negatively rather than positively correlated with digestive organ (gizzard) mass, as well as with body mass. In an experiment, we reciprocally reduced and increased individual gizzard masses and found that exploration scores were unaffected. Whether or not these birds were resighted locally over the 19 months after release was negatively correlated with their exploration scores. Moreover, a long-term mark–recapture effort on free-living red knots with known gizzard masses at capture confirmed that local resighting probability (an inverse measure of exploratory behaviour) was correlated with gizzard mass without detrimental effects on survival. We conclude that personality drives physiological adjustments, rather than the other way around, and suggest that physiological adjustments mitigate the survival costs of exploratory behaviour. Our results show that we need to reconsider hypotheses explaining personality variation based on organ sizes and differential survival.},

	abstract = {Developmental processes can have major impacts on the correlations in behaviour across contexts (contextual generality) and across time (temporal consistency) that are the hallmarks of animal personality. Personality can and does change: at any given age or life stage it is contingent upon a wide range of experiential factors that occurred earlier in life, from prior to conception through adulthood. We show how developmental reaction norms that describe the effects of prior experience on a given behaviour can be used to determine whether the effects of a given experience at a given age will affect contextual generality at a later age, and to illustrate how variation within individuals in developmental plasticity leads to variation in contextual generality across individuals as a function of experience. We also show why niche-picking and niche-construction, behavioural processes which allow individuals to affect their own developmental environment, can affect the contextual generality and the temporal consistency of personality. We conclude by discussing how an appreciation of developmental processes can alert behavioural ecologists studying animal personality to critical, untested assumptions that underlie their own research programmes, and outline situations in which a developmental perspective can improve studies of the functional significance and evolution of animal personality.},
