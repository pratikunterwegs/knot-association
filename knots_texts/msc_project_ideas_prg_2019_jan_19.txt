First and most basic, individual based models following Vahl's ideas, with pairwise interactions determining some contest outcome that translates to fitness. This implemented in an evolutionary system, where successful agents replicate, either with fixed or flexible population size. Second, some state dependence of behaviour to examine behaviour--physiology trade-offs (take a look at an example of dynamics in waders in the attached paper by Jan van Gils and Theunis). Third, and getting ambitious already, have the agent decisions (to compete or not) as the output of neural networks (an example of how dynamics change in a cooperation game is in the attached paper by Piet van den Berg and Franjo). Fourth, finally and optionally, but most excitingly, implementation in a limited spatial system -- competition has significant spatial effects (see Vahl et al. 2005b, 2007, and also Allert's papers on local enhancement and cryptic interference).
