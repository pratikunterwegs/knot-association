Waders such as red knots *Calidris canutus* are highly social, and
gather in large non-breeding flocks in the Wadden Sea, where they feed
on the macrozoobenthos buried in intertidal mudflats. Knots have been
shown to use social information in lab settings,[^1] and are
hypothesised to use communal roosts as information centres.[^2]

Persistent association with specific individuals could help knots make
use of collective sensing, or exploit an informed flockmate. We used
high frequency *(1 minute interval)* ATLAS[^3] tracking data to test
whether knots have non-random associations — in a sense, do knots have
‘friends’?

We found that of 556 unique knot pairs tracked over 44 tidal intervals
*(high tide to high tide, \~19 days)*, \~10% were associated
*(proportion of positions in proximity, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)* higher
than expected by chance. 10% were associated less than expected.

Within tidal intervals, knot association was highest in the hours just
before *(advancing tide)* and after *(receding tide)* high tide, and
lowest around low tide (Fig. 1).

Our results align with the idea that wader flocks are good examples of
random mixing driven by environmental effects.[^4]

However, red knots have been shown to have consistent individual
differences in exploratory behaviour, which may be linked to different
foraging needs and movement patterns.[^5] It remains to be tested
whether knot personality is a factor in determining association in the
dynamic Wadden Sea landscape.
