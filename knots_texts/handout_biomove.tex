\subsection{Introduction and Methods}

Waders such as red knots \emph{Calidris canutus} are highly social,
and gather in large non-breeding flocks in the Wadden Sea, where they
feed on the macrozoobenthos buried in intertidal mudflats. Knots have
been shown to use social information in lab settings\footnote{Bijleveld et al. 2015.\emph{ Behav. Processes}},
and are hypothesised to use communal roosts as information centres\footnote{Bijleveld et al. 2010.\emph{ Oikos}}.
Persistent association with specific individuals could help knots
make use of collective sensing, or exploit an informed flockmate.
We used high frequency\emph{ (1 minute interval) }ATLAS\footnote{Time of Arrival radio tracking using tags glued to dorsal surface;
5-point median filter applied.} tracking data to test whether knots have non-random associations
— in a sense, do knots have friends?

\subsection{Results}

We found that of 556 unique knot pairs tracked over 44 tidal intervals
\emph{(high tide to high tide, \textasciitilde{}19 days)}, only \textasciitilde{}10\%
had a co-occurence \emph{(proportion of positions in proximity)} higher
than expected by chance. Within tidal intervals, knot co-occurrence
was highest in the hours just before \emph{(advancing tide)} and after
\emph{(receding tide)} high tide, and lowest around low tide (Fig.
1).

\caption{\emph{Mean pair-wise co-occurrence over the tidal interval ${\pm}$ 95${\%}$ CI. Low tide at dashed line.}}
\end{marginfigure}We further found that the co-occurrence of a pair in the advancing
tide was not related to its co-occurrence prior to the foraging period\emph{,
i.e., }in the receding tide. However, pairs with high co-occurrence
in the advancing tide had travelled similar distances in the foraging
period around low tide.

\subsection{Discussion}

Our results align with the long-held notion that wader flocks are
good examples of random mixing driven by environmental effects\footnote{Myers 1983. \emph{Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol.}; Conklin \& Colwell 2007.
\emph{JOFO.}} — possibly, individual presence is sufficient to inform about the
resource landscape without individual identity being key. Further,
association and information use may occur at a larger or finer scale
than used here\footnote{Harrington \& Leddy 1982. \emph{Wader Study Group Bull.}}.

Red knots have been shown to have consistent individual differences
in exploratory behaviour, which may be linked to different foraging
needs and movement patterns\footnote{Bijleveld et al. 2014. \emph{Proc. Royal Soc. B.}}.
It remains to be tested both whether knots are more discriminating
about the \emph{kind}, rather than identity, of individuals with which
they associate.
