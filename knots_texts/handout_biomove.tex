\subsection{\textsf{Do knots have `friends'? ATLAS may provide answers}}

Waders such as red knots \emph{Calidris canutus} are highly social,
and gather in large non-breeding flocks in the Wadden Sea, where they
feed on the macrozoobenthos buried in intertidal mudflats. Knots have
been shown to use social information in lab settings,\footnote{Bijleveld et al. 2015.\emph{ Behav. Processes}}
and are hypothesised to use communal roosts as information centres.\footnote{Bijleveld et al. 2010.\emph{ Oikos}}

Persistent association with specific individuals could help knots
make use of collective sensing, or exploit an informed flockmate.
We used high frequency\emph{ (1 minute interval) }ATLAS\footnote{Time of Arrival radio tracking using 4.2 g tags glued to dorsal surface;
5-point median filter applied.} tracking data to test whether knots have non-random associations
â€” in a sense, do knots have `friends'?

\subsection{\textsf{Knot association is low, but 10\% of pairs are `friends'}}

We found that of 556 unique knot pairs tracked over 44 tidal intervals
\emph{(high tide to high tide, \textasciitilde{}19 days)}, \textasciitilde{}10\%
were associated \emph{(proportion of positions in proximity, Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test)} higher than expected by chance. 10\% were associated less than
expected.

\subsection{\textsf{Association is largely environmentally driven}}

Within tidal intervals, knot association was highest in the hours
just before \emph{(advancing tide)} and after \emph{(receding tide)}
high tide, and lowest around low tide (Fig. 1).

\subsection{\textsf{Conclusion \& future work}}

Our results align with the idea that wader flocks are good examples
of random mixing driven by environmental effects.\footnote{Myers 1983. \emph{Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol.}; Conklin \& Colwell 2007.
\emph{JOFO.}}

However, red knots have been shown to have consistent individual differences
in exploratory behaviour, which may be linked to different foraging
needs and movement patterns.\footnote{Bijleveld et al. 2014. \emph{Proc. Royal Soc. B.}}
It remains to be tested whether knot personality is a factor in determining
association in the dynamic Wadden Sea landscape.
