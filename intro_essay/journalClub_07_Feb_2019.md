We discussed a recent review paper by [Don DeAngelis](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/don-deangelis?qt-staff_profile_science_products=0#qt-staff_profile_science_products) and [Stepahnie Diaz](https://biology.as.miami.edu/people/graduate-students/index.html), [**Decision-making in agent-based modeling: A current review and future prospectus**](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2018.00237/full?utm_source=F-AAE&utm_medium=EMLF&utm_campaign=MRK_889258_6_Ecolog_20190122_arts_A). As a review paper, it lacked synthesis and came across as scattered. The paper focussed on decisions relating to movement (nearly 8 of 12 pages), but this wasn't evident from the title. The introduction didn't offer a justification for the focus, either, and other kinds of decisions such as social interactions were given short shrift. An evolutionary view was also lacking, with decision-making as a process not treated as subject to selection. In part, this is due to the state of the field, which appears to use agent-based models (ABMs) in very different ways, but all with a strong ecological focus.
For example, while some examples used ABMs to infer mechanisms ([Semeniuk et al. 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380012002761)), others use them to predict future effects ([Okunishi et al. 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380008004936)). The review often mentioned concepts, such as animal personality, without elaborating on interpretation. Similarly, the movement ecology paradigm ([Nathan et al. 2008](http://www.pnas.org/content/105/49/19052)) has unified thinking in animal movement, and forms the basis of much of this paper, but was mentioned only in passing.

On the plus side, the examples presented covered a range of study systems and the references should prove an instructive introductory reading list. Further, stimulated by our reading, the group is now actively considering a review of its own brand of agent-based modelling approaches with a strong evolutionary focus.
