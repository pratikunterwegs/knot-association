# Introduction

Movement ecology has emerged as a major unifying perspective in animal ecology and evolution, tying together phenomena across scales [@Nathan2008; @Jeltsch2013]. Its rise has been coupled with advances in animal tracking technologies, which enable both large scale and high resolution position logging of individuals from many taxa [@Kays2015; @Wikelski2007a; MOTUS, ATLAS]. The combination has yielded insights into the behavioural ecology of species -- from collective behaviour to energy expenditure to migration [that recent wildebeest msucle fibre paper, ian's fish tracking; Scantlebury paper]. Animal tracking datasets are frequently large enough to require novel methods to investigate questions of interest. For example, the study of sociality and information flow has drawn strongly from graph theory [many many damien papers], while assessing space-use ("home ranges") from high resolution tracking data has required modelling the autocorrelation of successive positions [AKDE citation]. The often opportunistic nature of collection means that comparing empirical tracking data against controls is difficult. Social network analysis has led the way by proposing the comparison of collected data with null models [cite damien and orr]. However, null models have been implemented as randomisations of empirical data, or as individual based models that do not take into account landscape level changes [cite damien and orr].

Intertidal mudflats, such as those of the Dutch Wadden Sea [coordinates], are one example of a constantly changing landscape. Different components of such tidal systems change at different rates. Of these, the exposure and flooding of the mudflats due to the tidal cycle is very regular and has a frequency of typically twice a day. This creates brief windows of opportunity for many species of shorebirds, including waders _Charadrii_ which feed on patches of buried macrozoobenthos (species of molluscs, worms, and arthropods). Waders locate prey that has secreted itself into the substratum by rapidly sampling with their bills; the bill tip contains Herbst corpuscles that are sensitive to the pressure wave returning from buried prey, if the substrate is sufficiently waterlogged. This makes tracking the tidal waterline a sound foraging strategy, since waders cannot swim and can only sample a limited depth below the surface (determined by bill length). Foraging waders harvest prey and reduce their numbers, leading to declines in prey abundance at spatial scales proportional to the time waders are present on the mudflats. The resource landscape for waders thus undergoes more local decline during summer, and may yet be renewed each high tide by inflows of prey taxa.

Wader populations are in global decline, making their intensive study a priority. Since waders are.
