# Introduction

## Introduction: Waders in the Wadden Sea

Waders such as red knots _Calidris canutus_ gather in large non-breeding flocks in the Wadden Sea, where they forage on the intertidal mudflats

```{r out.width="600px", fig.cap="Wadden Sea mudflats"}
knitr::include_graphics("~/git/knots/knots_texts/fig_mudflats.jpg")
```

## Knots benefit from sociality

Knots can use social information in lab settings to find food^[1]^, and may learn the location of profitable foraging patches by observing flock-mates^[2]^

## Do knots have friends?

Knots benefit from association, but do they have friends — persistent, non-random associations — within & between tidal intervals^[3][4]^?

# Methods: Tracking multitudes

## ATLAS tracking

We set up ATLAS --- a tracking tower system (n = 5) based on the **T**ime **o**f **A**rrival (**ToA**) of radio signals from tagged knots (n = 35)

```{r out.width="800px", fig.cap="Tracking tower and locations"}
knitr::include_graphics("~/git/knots/knots_texts/tracking_tower_map_picture.png")
```

## Tidal intervals

- We obtained water-level data from Harlingen

- Identified 44 tidal intervals (~12 hrs) over 19 calendar days

- Grouped each knot's movement tracks by tidal interval

## Co-occurrence

- Calculated co-occurrence <font size="7"> _c<sub>ij</sub>_ </font>

- <font size="7"> _c<sub>ij</sub>_ </font> = proportion of positions at which birds _i_ & _j_ were within 250 m of each other

```

# Results: Knot association is low

## Most knots rarely interact

```{r out.width="400px", fig.cap="Pair-wise co-occurrence distribution"}
knitr::include_graphics("~/git/knots/knots_texts/coherence_distribution.png")
```

## Knot co-occurrence is rarely different from random

```{r out.width="300px", fig.cap="Pair-wise co-occurrence matrix"}
knitr::include_graphics("~/git/knots/knots_texts/figure_coherence_matrix.png")
```

## Only ~10% of knot pairs are 'friends'

```{r out.width="400px", fig.cap="% of pairs with _c<sub>ij</sub>_ values higher than expected"}
knitr::include_graphics("~/git/knots/knots_texts/coherence_test_prop.png")
```

# Results: Knot association is environmentally driven

## Knot co-occurrence is tidally forced

```{r out.width="450px"}
knitr::include_graphics("~/git/knots/knots_texts/figure_coherence_hour_handout.png")
```

## Post foraging co-occurrence is unrelated to pre-foraging scores

- GLMM: post-foraging _c<sub>ij</sub>_ ~ pre-foraging _c<sub>ij</sub>_ + foraging period distance mismatch + (1|pair) + (1|tidal interval)

- Pre-foraging _c<sub>ij</sub>_ is not a significant effect (z = 1.738, _p_-value = 0.08)

- Knots don't re-unite with pre-foraging 'friends'

## Post-foraging co-occurrence _is_ related to distance mismatch

- Knots which travel similar distances during foraging are more closely associated post-foraging (z = -2.72, _p_-value = 0.006)

```

# Discussion

## At what scales do interactions happen?

- Wader interactions may occur at scales not measured here

- Knots have previously been shown to be non-randomly associated^[5]^

<font size="4"> 5: Harrington & Leddy 1982. _Wader Study Group Bull._ </font>

## Neighbour _type_ might matter more than identity: Future work

- Knots have consistent personalities re: exploratory behaviour^[6]^

- May associate with individuals of similar personality due to shared resource requirements

- Identification of neighbour personality may still require sustained association
