# Linking experimental measures of personality to free-living space-use in red knots

This repository is the source for a project in preparation that links high-resolution tracking data from individual red knots _Calidris canutus islandica_ to fine-scale experimental behaviour measurements in captivity, and examines whether individuals are consistent across scales in their space-use.
