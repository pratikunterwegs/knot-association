### Community consequences of foraging under fear

**Lisa Teckentrup, _Biomove and University of Potsdam_**

An individual based model of animal movement was used to construct home ranges, and calculate overlap to examine 'community' assembly in the landscape. Under the influence of fear, there was a decrease in diversity _(indicated by a shift to smaller home ranges overall, resulting in less overlap - prg)_, and a shift to smaller animal body sizes. Large, safe, patches support the highest prey diversity. See Creel 2008, Laundre et al. 2010.

### Online performance estimation in ATLAS systems

**Ingo Schiffner, _Minerva Center for Movement Ecology, Jerusalem_**

There is a useful online tool that can be used by ATLAS system operators to quantify system performance in terms of how many tags are being received, and at what rate, and the rough coverage area. _Only useful for ATLAS system engineers and proximate operators. - prg_

### Statistical inference for home range overlap

**Justin Calabrese, _Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute_**

Most animals have a home range, and there are a number of statistical techniques to quantify home range overlap (Fieberg? and Kochanny 2005). No home range metrics have a confidence interval option. Methods such as the KDE are particularly problematic in this regard. The autocorrelated kernel density estimator is a better method, and can use the Bhattacharya coefficient as a measure of overlap of the home ranges. This is implemented by the `R` package `ctmm` (Calabrese et al. 2015), with a downstream application in multiple areas of movement reseach.

### Are individual differences in fish movement related to angling vulnerability? A whole-lake reality mining experiment in the wild using four species

**Chritopher Monk, _IGB and Humbolt University Berlin_**

Individual differences in fish movement may be drivers of vulnerability to angling --- not all fish are fished alike (see Borrell 2013). 'Timidity syndrome' may play a role (Arlinghaus xx TREE, Arlinghaus 2013), and vulnerability to angling is complicated (Lennor et al. 2017, Cox and Waters 2002). Carp, tench, perch, and pike were caught using nets in a lake and fitted with acoustic time of arrival tags picked up by underwater microphones to determine movement and vulnerability to angling; anglers were given GPS devices when they went on to the lake. All four species showed different activity patterns consistent with niche separation. It was not clear what determines vulnerability to angling but angling style for each species is different and may play a role.

### Cultural transmission shapes migratory behaviour of whooping crane populations

**Philipp Mendgen, _University of Göttingen and BiKF Senckenberg_**

Does cultural transmission matter in migratory behaviour of _whooping cranes_? A series of conservation and management decisions allow for this to be tested in three crane populations which were 1. raised by wild parents and trained on migration by wild parents, 2. raised by humans and trained on migration by re-introduced conspecifics, and 3. raised and trained to migrate by humans. Choice of wintering site was the response of interest. Human trained cranes show winter short-stopping _(migration along only part of the 'traditional' route, with a wintering site short of that used by completely wild populations - prg)_ (see Teitelbaum et al. 2016). Populations' wintering site may differ because they use two different but parallel flyways. The environment was found to be suitable at short-stopping latitudes along both flyways, but this region was not occupied by wild parent-trained cranes. A possible loss of flexibility is posited due to long parental care.

### Breeding dispersal slows down diversification rates in shorebirds

**Clemens Küpper, _Max Planck Institute for Ornithology Seewiesen_**

Dispersal abilities can be linked to genetic differentiation; breeding dispersal _(meant here as dispersal during the breeding season, wherein dispersal refers to movements of adults rather than the dispersal of juveniles out of the natal territory - prg)_ is higher in polygamous systems (see Kempenaers and Valeu 2017 on pectoral sandpipers). Many waders show both strong breeding movements as well as _(post breeding)_ migration. Question: Is sexual selection a brake on, or a driver of, speciation in shorebirds? For e.g., bioluminescent fireflies with relatively high sexual selection have a higher diversity.

In plovers, Küpper et al. 2012 show that in the _Kentish plover_ there is no population structure, while monogamous species have more structure, polygamous a little less. This points to the idea that sexual selection is a brake on speciation, and breeding dispersal may play a role. However, island population have been excluded in this work, and future work will focus on the movements of the _snowy plover_ (by Luke Eberhardt-Phillips, see d'Urban Jackson et al. 2017).
